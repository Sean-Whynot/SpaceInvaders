## How to Download and Run the Game

This game is written in Python. To play, you'll need Python installed on your computer.

### Step 1: Install Python (if you don't have it)

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Follow the instructions on the website to install Python. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation, as this makes it easier to run Python programs.

### Step 2: Download the Game

1.  Open your web browser and go to the game's page on GitHub (if applicable). If you received the game as a `.zip` file, skip to Step 3.
2.  Look for a green button that says "**Code**" and click on it.
3.  In the small menu that appears, click on "**Download ZIP**".
4.  Save the `SpaceInvaders.zip` file to a folder on your computer where you want to keep the game (e.g., your "Downloads" folder or a new "Games" folder).

### Step 3: Extract the Game Files

1.  Find the `SpaceInvaders.zip` file you downloaded.
2.  **Right-click** on the `SpaceInvaders.zip` file.
3.  Select "**Extract All...**" or "**Unzip**" (the exact wording might vary depending on your operating system).
4.  A new window will appear asking where you want to extract the files. You can usually just click "**Extract**" to extract them to a new folder with the same name (`SpaceInvaders`) in the same location.

### Step 4: Run the Game

1.  Open the `SpaceInvaders` folder that was created after extraction.
2.  Inside this folder, you will see many files and folders. Look for a file named `main.py`.
3.  **Double-click** on `main.py`.

    *   If Python is installed correctly and "Add Python to PATH" was checked, the game should start!
    *   If it doesn't start, or a black window flashes and disappears, it means Python might not be set up to run `.py` files by double-clicking. In that case, you can try this:
        1.  In the `SpaceInvaders` folder, click on the address bar at the top (where it shows the folder path, like `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\SpaceInvaders`).
        2.  Type `cmd` and press Enter. A black command prompt window will open.
        3.  In the command prompt, type `python main.py` and press Enter.
            The game should now start.
